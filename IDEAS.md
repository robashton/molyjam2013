# Brainstorming

- Start off with a single acorn
  - Plant it
  - The goal is to grow that tree so we can harvest a golden acorn

- Can water it
- Can watch it grow

- The tree will shed acorns

- We can use those acorns to feed squirrels
- We can use those acorns to heal up
- We can use those acorns for everything

- Those squirrels will bring you things (perhaps this is expensive)
  - That implies an inventory of stuff
  - We can get stuff from questing too

- With an inventory we can do quests
- quests are just text and decisions in a decision tree of some sort
- We can level up, when we level up the number of acorns we have impacts
 - how much hp we get extra
 - how much defence we get extra
 - etc etc

So the game is about balancing the spending of acorns for short term gain, vs hoarding them for long term gain

# MVP

- Acorn, plant it
- See a visual representation of that tree
- Have an increasing acorn count
- Have a health counter
- Have the ability to go on a single text-driven quest
  - Make decisions (left/right/etc)
  - Heal
  - Fight
  - Turn based
  - On reaching 1000 acorns, we get the golden acorn
